Tip on Demand is a brain child of a prolonged though process and extensive brainstorming for a solution to fight mood swings. It is very general to have mood swings, sadness, depression in young adults.

Happiness and sadness are transient.

This too shall pass.

These are just two of the lines from the various sources of the intent or the motivation to the app.

Coming to the idea, when a person is sad, one thing that can change his mind is diverting his thought process or the thought branch in another happier direction. If someone is sad about an event in the recent past, he can think of something entirely different from his distant past that made him really happy. This works all the time. For example, if someone is sad that his teacher called him useless, he/she can think of some great achievement that he had in the past or a hilarious event from the past that he laughed his lungs out or something of that sort.

A person can open this app in two situations. 
1. When he’s sad, to help him remind something happy from the past.
2. And when he’s happy to record it in his app. It’s like storing your happiness for future when you need it.

After a lot of brainstorming with my friends, I split the app into two parts.

The first one is to inculcate, the dying art of writing a diary, into people. Writing a diary works in a similar way as that of our app. We store our memories for future. For us to read it someday and relish those moments through words.

The second one is something similar to a cast to the world. This one adds more meaning and intensity to the thought. While the first one is confined to one person, this one is open to the world. Every time a user learns something or is very happy and wants to share it with the world, he/she just posts it. And other users will randomly get any of the posts of any user across the world. It’s like someone is really cares for you, someone hopes for your best and sends those. And it’s really great to have such consistent reminders, words for our better being.
